# Appointment-Booking-System
A simple booking/appointment page using html, css and js.
-- It should consist of a way to pick date and time of appointment, on a calendar type of UI.
-- It should grey out/ show red marking for already reserved date and time of other users.
-- It should take in user information such as Name, Email and Phone number.
-- Using Django create a backend for the same. It should save all the data into MySQL.
-- Fetch the MySQL data and display these date and time on the previously created HTML page on calendar and mark them grey/red.
-- Your backend should perform two things after a booking has been made:
1. Send an email to admin email ID.
2. Send an SMS to admin phone number. (Use Amazon SNS)
-- Create a login page for admin - A dashboard where admin can see:
-- All bookings which can be filtered using particular dates.
-- All customers information
